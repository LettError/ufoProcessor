# ufoProcessor
Python package based on the **designSpaceDocument** (now fontTools.designSpaceLib) specifically to process and generate UFO files.

When the dust of the move has settled I'll make the remove `designSpaceDocument.py` and point to the current file at fontTools. In the mean time and for the sake of continuity (and keeping some things running) it is here.
